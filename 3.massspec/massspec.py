# choose file ie assign filename to a variable. for coding purposes it will be dummy.peps
#
# create dictionary of M/C ratios of amino acids 
# mono vs isotopic masses?
# 
# 
# create dictionary for each peptide, using fasta heading as the keys
# assign the peptide number (ie if its the 1st, second etc) to the first[0] item in the list
# assign the assigns the correct m/c ratio value for each amino acid in the peptide string # to a total
# value at position 2 [1] of the list
# assigns a default value of 1 for charge to 3rd [2] list item
# assign a value of p to 4th position [3]. can this be taken from 2's? work out how to do anyway.
# assign the sequence string to 4th positon in the dictionary 
# 
# output dictionary in table format
