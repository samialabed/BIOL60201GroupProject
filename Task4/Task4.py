Read mass column
Separate results by enzyme
Define mass column ranges (user entry)
  Define your range, input (entry min value)
  Define your range, input (entry max value)
    or 
  Define number of bins, input(how many bins want to visualice in hystogram)
Count the number of peptides on each range, for each enzyme
  Total of peptides
  Subtotal of peptides with ions (ionA, ionB, ...)
Calculate mean values of mass on each range/bin for each enzyme
  Mean for all peptides by range
  Mean of peptides by ions type (ionA, ionB, ...)
Calculate instruments accuracy (error) for each enzyme
Count peptides with Cys or Met
Transform mass values from Da to ppm (conversion formula)
Report CSV
